# Write a python program to take two numbers as command line arguments and perform their addition.

# Take a standard input from user with input() function and typecast it to float.
a = float(input("Enter first number: "))
b = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Addition of two numbers
result = a + b

#print result
print("Addition:", result)
