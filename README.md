# Applied Machine Learning

### The repository contains the solutions to the problem statements for the academic course Applied Machine Learning under Minor Degree, Data Science.

The directories correspondingly contain the python scripts starting from python basics and covering the clustering, classification, and regression problems. The regression problem implements a linear model on the area of the houses to predict the prices. The model assumes Gaussian data with mean squared error as the loss function. The classification performs logistic regression. The clustering problem uses a k-means algorithm.
